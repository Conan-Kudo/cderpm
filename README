cderpm
======

RPM spec file, patches, and scripts to package up the Common Desktop Environment.

The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) from The Open Group is now available under
the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later (LGPLv2+).  The project
can be found here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/

This project is an RPM spec file and related files used to build an installable
CDE package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Linux systems.


TARGET PLATFORMS
----------------

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (x86_64 and i686)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (x86_64 and i686)
CentOS 6 (x86_64 and i686)

I may not have all platforms building at a given time, which is why I refer to
them as targets rather than requirements.  I'm always interested in patches to
get things building and packaging on other Red Hat-derived distributions.
